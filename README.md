MICROVERSE CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Capstone Project Title: Capstone-Kemsol-Music-Center

This capstone project was created a using HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP. In this project I was required to create a customised Website(In my own case I made it to be Musical Instruments Website intead of Electronics Website in the original) with Homepage and Search Results Page which is a replica of [ZATTIX](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX) by Mohammed Awad. The home page is the landing page from where one can navigate to search results page by clicking search button at the top in the home page.
